In this folder, /src/components/CustomDemos/ I will put a couple of files for testing and demonstrating two features.

1) the ability for nodes to specify a custom component for a field, instead of using the built in type-field

2) the ability for nodes to specify a custom component for their entire UI, so none of the default field rows will render
