/*
	VTypeCollection.js
	-------------------

	This file provides a class that will manage a collection of type values the node system users.

	The NWEditor will instantiate a default version of this class with built-in types,
	but developers can also instantiate their own VTypeCollection & provide it to the component.

	This will also support the type coalescing system.
